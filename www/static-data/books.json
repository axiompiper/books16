Amy Stewart resurrects a very real heroine from history.  In 1914 New Jersey, Constance Kopp dared to pursue justice for herself and her sisters.  The story is set in motion by what must have been pretty common back then -- horse buggy versus car accident.  The adventures that follow are anything but mundane and set Constance on a path to becoming one of the first female deputy Sheriffs in the U.S.  And how I smiled when I found out this is the first of a trilogy!", "reviewer": "Shannon Rhoades", "slug": "girl-waits-with-gun", "tags": []}, {"isbn": "1610395735", "links": [], "isbn13": "9781610395731", "author": "Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan", "reviewer_id": "correspondent, International Desk", "hide_ibooks": "", "book_seamus_id": "", "title": "The Red Web: The Struggle Between Russia's Digital Dictators And The New Online Revolutionaries", "reviewer_link": "http://www.npr.org/people/2100491/corey-flintoff", "oclc": "", "text": "The Red Web is an exploration of how the Russian state uses the internet as a tool for surveillance and cyber-aggression, at the same time dissidents are trying to use it as a channel for free expression.

The book covers a vast swath of Russian history, from 1930s Leningrad to modern day.  It is simultaneously tragic, absurd, and poignant.  The last story is his only overreach, but it doesn't matter.
