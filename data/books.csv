A God in Ruins,Kate Atkinson,Ari Shapiro,0,Nicole,,0,1,,,,,,,,,"Buy a house in East London today, and a realtor may warn you that the foundation is uneven because of bomb damage from World War 2. British people have a more personal relationship to the second World War than most Americans do. That immediacy comes through vividly in Kate Atkinson’s novel, A God In Ruins. Her main character, Teddy, is a heroic fighter pilot, whose exploits feel more harrowing than heroic. It’s Atkinson’s second book exploring the same family, after her virtuosic 2013 novel, Life After Life. We should be so lucky to get a third. "

A Little Life: A Novel,Hanya Yanagihara,Audie Cornish,0,Nicole,,1,,,,,,,,,,"At nearly 800 pages A Little Life feels like it’s telling the story of its New York foursome in real time – over takeout, at parties, in dinners that end in arguments. It’s most moving when author Hanya Yanagihara lets us live long stretches with the character of Jude -- a survivor of child abuse. The book doesn't shy away from those horrors or the physical and emotional pain endured to overcome them. And it’s not afraid to show how his friends love him, care for him and sometimes let him down."
Delicious Foods: A Novel,James Hannaham,Audie Cornish,0,Nicole,,1,,,,,,,,,,Delicious Foods starts where some other books might end. Its hero – Eddie – is a bloodied survivor. The book tells us how he got there. Through the corrupt farm where he and other unlucky job seekers end up trapped and treated like modern day slaves. And it’s a bittersweet story of a young man and his drug addled mother -- a woman who careens through life -- despite his best efforts to hold on.

"Dylan Goes Electric!: Newport, Seeger, Dylan, and the Night That Split the Sixties",Elijah Wald,Cheryl Devall ,0,Nicole,,0,0,,,,,,,,,"Every folk music lover thinks s/he knows what happened July 25, 1965 at the Newport Folk Festival when a scruffy, much-loved American protest singer whipped out a Stratocaster. What followed rivals the 1913 premiere of Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring” in the annals of musical disruption. Fortunately, cultural historian Wald wasn’t content to let sleeping legends lie. Wald revisits the infamous concert set through contemporary accounts (including pages from one fan’s scrapbook) and interviews with surviving participants. The result leaves those of us who weren’t there wishing we had been. It’s rollicking, poignant and fun."
Katrina: After the Flood,Gary Rivlin,Cheryl Devall ,0,Nicole,,0,0,,,,,,,Eye-Opening Reads,,"Investigative reporters have long followed this rule from Woodward and Bernstein’s Watergate playbook: “Follow the money.” Rivlin applies that dictum to power, politics and planning in New Orleans before and after the infamous 2005 deluge. With its focus on the central role of black-owned Liberty Bank in the development of areas inhabited largely by New Orleans’ African American professional class, the book offers a strong, infuriating argument that Katrina was a catastrophe decades in the making, abetted by the powers that be on the local, state and national level. The narrative includes heroes, too: Liberty’s chief executive Alden McDonald, the publishers of the monthly New Orleans Tribune and the endearingly bourgeois, resourceful and indomitable Wall sisters Petie, Contesse, Cassandra and Tangee.  "
Between the World and Me,Ta-Nehisi Coates,Cheryl Devall ,0,Nicole,,1,0,,,,,,,,,"This volume – conceived as a letter from the author to his son, Samori – punches way above its weight as provocation and analysis. As in his Polk Award-winning article for The Atlantic, “The Case for Reparations,” this book intends to unsettle complacency with research and bracing rhetoric. Its central question: “How do I live free in this black body?” is far less haunting, Coates argues, than the ever-fresh episodes of violence against black bodies that made possible this nation that prides itself on its striving toward “a more perfect union.” In beautiful prose, Coates bequeaths to his child the clear-eyed approach of his parents, “who never tried to console me with ideas of an afterlife and were skeptical of preordained American glory.” Those gifts, he maintains, make it possible for him to pose unanswerable questions without fearing the consequences. Some readers may regard his conclusions as grim; others are likely to find them liberating. Discuss among yourselves."

It reads like a spy novel, and there’s a lot of fascinating history about the state campaign to control the web, from Soviet times to today.  It’s a great piece of investigative reporting."
The Wright Brothers,David McCullough,Edith Chapin,0,Nicole,,0,0,,,,,,,,,"Most school kids know that Wilbur and Orville Wright were the first to fly a mechanized plane. Their story is so much more than that simple fact as David McCullough lays out in his typical crisp and compelling style. The brothers were an unlikely  pair,  complementing each other at every stage and thriving in their insular world. Their sister Katherine was instrumental in their success in many ways and she too took to the skies. More than a century later the Wright family trials and successes are as captivating as if they took place last year."
Secrets of State,Matthew Palmer,Edith Chapin,0,Nicole,,0,0,,,,,,,,,"In his second novel Matthew Palmer plunges into the murky world of Washington consulting firms full of former insiders who have trouble giving up their stock in power and influence. The story revolves around suspicions of fake intelligence to provoke India and Pakistan to up their nuclear rivalry. Conspiracy theorists will enjoy the shadowy world of The Stoics, a secret group of government bureaucrats dating back to the early days of the republic who are determined to reshape the world by circumventing official policy. The story is so captivating you can’t help but wonder if it might be slightly plausible after all."
The New Tsar: The Rise and Reign of Vladimir Putin,Steven Lee Myers,Edith Chapin,0,Nicole,,0,0,,,,,,,,,"If you are perplexed and intrigued by the enigmatic Vladimir Putin, you’ll want to read this biography. You’ll get a better understanding behind and beyond the stereotypes of the workaholic leader driven by the humiliation and chaos of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Reserved and suspicious by nature, Putin is determined to project Russia as a great power and to unify the country with him at its center. His motivations from Chechnya to the Olympics to Ukraine to Syria are a lot clearer thanks to Myers’ detailed reporting."

The Unmapped Sea (The Incorrigible Children of Ashton Place: Book V) AUDIOBOOK,Maryrose Wood,Emily Harris,0,Nicole,,0,1,,,,,,,,,"I never counted months to book publication until I finished listening to Book IV of the Incorrigible Children series and howled for more. Phrases like “op-too-much-istic” –hopeful in that way that sets the stage for perilous disappointment - from the droll, fantastic tale of children raised by wolves, mysteriously connected to the cursed Ashton family of Victorian-era estate life, guided through danger and artistic development by their sensible and endearing teenage governess have made it into my family’s everyday conversation. With spent children “draped over the furniture limp as empty coats,” and ominous encounters with Russian hat and beet nobility, finishing The Unmapped Sea left me counting again. "

The deft pacing of his second novel, Spy Games, kept me reading every free moment, including workday lunches and cab rides home.
What separates Brookes from many others in the genre is he knows his subject – China – intimately. (Disclosure: Brookes and I were colleagues when he served as a BBC correspondent in Beijing in the 1990s.) Brookes has ripped the plot of Spy Games from the headlines of a real-life Communist Party power-struggle and set it in London, Ethiopia, Hong Kong and a Chinese casino in the jungles of Myanmar. For an atmospheric tale of intrigue centered on the world’s rising super power, Brookes is your man.

Helen Castor spends the first 89 pages of this biography setting up a world of blood and betrayal before Joan even makes her entrance. When The Maid finally wades into this political snake pit, her power to  move hearts and armies is both mysterious and astonishing. Castor never goes beyond the bounds of the documents and never succumbs to the modern impulse to psychoanalyze her heroine.  This Joan is a creature of her time: used, destroyed, and sanctified to serve the aims of the powerful. "

As with any series, I started reading The Penderwicks in Spring with nervous anticipation. Would we still like them? Would they be true to who we’ve grown to know? Yes and yes. And what we loved (I say we, because I read the book as I have all of the Penderwicks with my twin daughters), was that Batty who has charmed us from the start got to come of age and we saw the oldest, Rosalind, off to college. Jeanne Birdsall has given us the gift of sisterly love again."
Pool,Jihyeon Lee,Justine Kenin,0,Nicole,,1,,,,,,,,,,"Pool by JiHyeon Lee is a gorgeous fantasy. It’s a wordless picture book that takes readers and the two protagonists away from an overly crowded pool to a world far below where they frolic with wondrous sea creatures big and small. The colored pencil & oil pastel drawings are so engaging and playful and warm  that they do the thing the best books do keep your eyes roving the pages for little treasures.   Since Pool is Lee’s first book, I can’t wait to see what she creates next."
"Single, Carefree, Mellow: Stories",Katherine Heiny ,Justine Kenin,0,Nicole,,0,1,,,,,,,,,"Be ready to laugh and hoot and buy Katherine Heiny’s story collection --  Single, Carefree, Mellow -- for all your girlfriends, but probably not your mother-in-law.   Each story doles out gems that are so authentic and outrageous you want to read them out loud to your sister over the phone, like the opening lines of the story “Blue Heron Bridge” – “The worst thing about the affair, Nina thought, was that it made her so impatient with the children. She had not thought that would be the worst part. She thought the guilt would be the worst thing, or the stress of constant deception, or falling out of love with her husband, or some awful day of reckoning, but so far none of these things had happened. Only the impatience.”  "
Waiting ,Kevin Henkes,Justine Kenin,0,Nicole,,0,0,,,,,,,,,"Kevin Henkes is an amazing author.  His range of skill from picture books to young adult novels is without match.  So it’s no surprise that his latest picture book, Waiting, is so terrific.  The dance of words and pictures is subtle and simple and clever and rewards the careful observer.  A collection of toys sits in a windowsill– without a child in the picture, which lets the reader play that role.  Perfect for night after night after night of reading and re-reading like any great picture book."
Goodbye Stranger,Rebecca Stead,Justine Kenin,0,Nicole,,0,1,,,,,,,,,"The structure of Goodbye Stranger and the respect author, Rebecca Stead, gives her main characters drive this amazing book.  It centers on a group of girlfriends entering middle school, how they define and redefine themselves, determined to stick together.  Scenes with these girls cut to scenes of an older girl, who remains a mystery for much of the book, but whose world overlaps the younger girls.  It’s a funny and warm page turner that challenges conventional wisdom about mean girls and social media."
"Listen, Slowly",Thanhhà Lại,Justine Kenin,0,Nicole,,1,,,,,,,,,,"Listen, Slowly is a sort of reverse migration-adventure-coming of age story.  A middle school girl from California, Mai, whose parents and grandparents are from Vietnam, spends one summer back in her family’s home country – partly looking after her grandmother and partly helping her find out the truth about what happened to her grandfather during the Vietnam war.   Enjoy Thanhha Lai’s humor as she immerses  the reader and Mai in Vietnamese life."

You are supposed to wait for your monster in Maryln's world and not go out looking for it. Marliyn decides to take matters into her own hands and strike out on her own in this lovely exciting tale for toddlers. Not a lot of books meant for kids have tension, work on multiple levels and whose drawings can endlessly fascinate but this book has it all. I just took it away for the weekend and we read it to kids as young as 3 and as old as 9 and they all asked for it again. The takeaways for me were you sometimes have to push boundaries to get what you want and also monsters aren't that scary if they need to be rescued. SPOILER ALERT : Marliyn does find her monster. Added bonus : it's great for boys and girls but it has a spunky female heroine. "

Together, the pair plot their escape after years of propaganda films, bizarre dinner parties and excruciating torture. This book reads so much like a thriller, that sometimes you have to stop and remind yourself it's completely true. Fischer gives a fascinating look inside the manic imagination of Jong-Il and the tenacity of two people who found themselves in a situation right out of a movie.  "

Amy Stewart resurrects a very real heroine from history.  In 1914 New Jersey, Constance Kopp dared to pursue justice for herself and her sisters.  The story is set in motion by what must have been pretty common back then -- horse buggy versus car accident.  The adventures that follow are anything but mundane and set Constance on a path to becoming one of the first female deputy Sheriffs in the U.S.  And how I smiled when I found out this is the first of a trilogy!"

First, it reads like a novel.  Second, you will never doubt that Anthony Marra is in charge.  I began to imagine him standing before a giant bulletin board of timelines, maps, character bios -- like some God-like puppeteer, moving everything into place exactly as he wanted it.  The book covers a vast swath of Russian history, from 1930s Leningrad to modern day.  It is simultaneously tragic, absurd, and poignant.  The last story is his only overreach, but it doesn't matter.  All you really need to know is that you should read this book."

Walsh,Shannon Rhoades,0,Nicole,,,,,,,,,,,,"A close-knit neighborhood in Baton Rouge, Louisiana is forever changed after a teenaged girl is attacked ""in the dark turn beneath the first busted streetlight in the history of Piney Creek Road.""  As I started this novel, I thought, do I need another girl in peril story written by a man from the point of view of a man?  The writing, stewed in secrets and southern humidity, pulled me in though.  And then something happened at the end, which made me want to pull the reading equivalent of a U-turn, to double back and reread from the very beginning."
The Battle of Versailles: The Night American Fashion Stumbled into the Spotlight and Made History,Robin Givhan,Shannon Rhoades,0,Nicole,,,1,,,,,,,,,"You know that cliché about history ""coming alive?""  Well, in the hands of Pulitzer Prize-winning fashion critic Robin Givhan, this history really does come alive.  On a chilly November night back in 1973, five American designers went toe-to-toe, dress-to-dress, with five French designers in one legendary fashion show.  Seemingly, it was a fundraiser for the restoration of the Place of Versailles.  Lift the hemline just a smidge though, and there is so much at play here -- race, gender, the new world pushing up against the old.  If you're tempted to dismiss this as simply fashion history, don’t."
"In a Dark, Dark Wood",Ruth Ware,Shannon Rhoades,0,Nicole,,,1,,,,,,,,,"Home sick with a brain-numbing flu bearing down, I was unable to put this book down.  A crime writer wakes with amnesia and the sinking feeling that she has done something bad.  Then the story shifts to a group of twenty-somethings gathered at a remote English country home for a ""hen"" or bachelorette party.  There will be murder.  There will be delightful tips of the pen to Agatha Christie.  You will probably sniff out who is to blame -- but only when you're within striking distance of the end -- and in no way will that spoil the fun."

In a comfy chair in my parents’ living room, with a picture window view of fog and tree skeletons:  I found a safe perch to read this very unsafe book.  18 year-old Caitlin goes missing on a family vacation in the Rocky Mountains.  A stoic father will remain behind, always looking.  An unlikable character will surprise you.  And there will be an ascent -- a drive up, up into the mountains through switchback turns and snow -- that is excruciatingly satisfying.  Long since a big 2015 thriller -- ""The Girl on the Train"" -- evaporated from my reading brain, I am still thinking about ""Descent"".  "
The First Collection of Criticism by a Living Female Rock Critic,Jessica Hopper,Tyler Fisher,0,Nicole,,,1,,,,,,,,,"This brilliant collection of music writing by Pitchfork senior editor Jessica Hopper strikes quickly with its direct, biting title. Thankfully, the book continues to challenge commonplace criticism throughout its duration. Compiling work ranging from 2002 to 2014, the book covers both the problematic treatment of female characters in mid-2000s emo lyrics and the abandonment of Christianity by one of Christian rock’s foremost heroes in mere pages. Music fans would struggle to find a more compelling series of essays anywhere."

A History of Money,Alan Pauls,Juan Vidal,1,Petra,,1,0,,,,,,,"Realistic Fiction, Historical Fiction",,"In The History of Money, Argentinian novelist Alan Pauls frames a brilliant and absorbing tale through the lens of money and materialism. Translated by Ellie Robins, the novel delves into the troubled political and economic history of Argentina. As great stories often do, it begins with a body, that of a steel company executive who, sent to deliver an attaché case full of money, dies in a helicopter crash. Was this event an accident or a planned execution? The unnamed narrator asks these questions while also weaving stories concerning his personal history with money and how it complicates our lives. Pauls' book is a beautifully textured one chalk full with sentences that consistently dazzle the reader."
Where the Bird Sings Best,Alejandro Jodorowsky,Juan Vidal,1,Petra,,1,0,,,,,,,"Seriously Great Writing, The Dark Side",,"Where the Bird Sings Best is Alejandro Jodorowsky's brilliant, mad, and unpredictable semi-autobiographical novel. Translated by Alfred MacAdam, this multigenerational chronicle introduces a host of memorable characters, from a dwarf prostitute and a floating ghost-Rabbi, to a lion tamer who eats raw meat and teaches his beasts to jump through flaming hoops. Fantastical elements aside, Where the Bird Sings Best is a fiercely original immigration tale that culminates in the author's birth in Chile in 1929 — a complicated time in that nation's history. Combine that with poetry, Tarot, and Jewish mysticism and you have a genius' surreal vision brought to life. "
My Documents,Alejandro Zambra,Juan Vidal,1,Petra,,1,0,,,,,,,"Poetry & Short Stories, Seriously Great Writing",,"In My Documents, a collection of 11 stories translated by Megan McDowell, Alejandro Zambra tells stories like only he can. He finds the foundations for his most enthralling work in the complex ties between fathers and sons, nations and their people, and especially hapless lovers. To read Zambra and a collection like My Documents is to engage with someone who writes as though the burden of history were upon him and no one else — the history of his country of Chile, of literature, and of humanity's shared experience. Put simply, the novel is a force, and further proof that the author is in a class of his own."
The Dead Mountaineer's Inn,Boris & Arkady Strugatsky,Juan Vidal,1,Petra,,,,,,,,,,Science Fiction & Fantasy,,"The Dead Mountaineer's Inn by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky is a smart and a deeply funny tale that sends its readers down unpredictable paths. Translated in English for the first time by Josh Billings, the novel is centered around an odd cast of characters that are completely disconnected from the world and one another. First published in 1970, it follows police inspector Peter Glebsky, a family man anticipating two weeks of vacation, his first in years. Shortly after arriving at the inn, however, strange things begin to unravel, and Glebsky realizes his vacation will be anything but relaxing. After a body surfaces, the story takes on a new level of strange and readers are thrown into a detective story that is nothing short of exhilarating."
The Ghost Network,Catie Disabato,Juan Vidal,1,Petra,,0,1,,,,,,,Realistic Fiction,,"The Ghost Network is Catie Disabato's sharp and inventive debut novel. It tells the story of pop star Molly Metropolis who, while en route to a show in Chicago, vanishes mysteriously. Her personal assistant Nix takes on the role of detective, searching for clues in Molly's journal and going down a rabbit hole of abandoned subway lines, song lyrics, and secret societies. Disabato weaves a fast-paced and brilliantly structured story that is at once fiercely controlled and highly obsessive."
The Complete stories,Clarice Lispector,Juan Vidal,1,Petra,,1,1,,,,,,,"Poetry & Short Stories, Seriously Great Writing",,"In The Complete Stories, Clarice Lispector proves herself to be a true master of narrative. The collection, translated by Katrina Dodson, is a perfect introduction to those not familiar with Lispector's work. It is beautifully structured and poignant on all levels. Stories like ""The Escape"" and ""Daydream and Drunkenness of a Young Lady” — which deals with a discontented housewife on the brink of insanity — stay with you like a kind of dream. These 85 stories, some spanning only a few pages, reaffirm her singularity and her reputation as ""the great witch of Brazilian literature."" Long after her death, Lispector continues to champion the possibilities of language, and its ability to mesmerize."
Tropisms,Nathalie Sarraute,Juan Vidal,1,Petra,,0,1,,,,,,,Poetry & Short Stories,,"Originally published in 1939, Tropisms is the stunning debut of the late Nathalie Sarraute, long considered one of France's most important writers. The author, who's work went on to be translated to dozens of languages, once described her first novel as the “interior movements that precede and prepare our words and actions, at the limits of our consciousness.” This collection of vignettes – made of short scenes and anecdotes – reads like quiet prose poems that stay with the reader. Translated by Maria Jolas, Tropisms is a short albeit powerful masterpiece in every sense."
A Planet for Rent,Yoss,Juan Vidal,1,Petra,,1,,,,,,,,Science Fiction & Fantasy,,"A Planet for Rent is the English-language debut of Yoss, one of Cuba's most lauded writers of Science Fiction. Translated by David Frye, the interwoven stories craft a picture of a dystopian future in which an alien species called ""Xenoids"" has invaded planet Earth. Many of the planet's inhabitants are looking to flee, as it has become economically and socially bankrupt. Yoss's smart and entertaining novel tackles themes like prostitution, immigration, and political corruption. Ultimately, it serves as an empathetic yet impassioned metaphor for modern day Cuba, where the struggle for power has complicated every facet of society. "

Did You Ever Have a Family,Bill Clegg,Heller McAlpin,1,Rose,,0,0,,,,,,, Book Club ideas; Family Matters; Realistic Fiction; the Dark Side; Seriously Great Writing,,"Bill Clegg’s polished, deeply compassionate debut novel digs through the ashes of a tragic fire that wipes out a woman’s nearest and dearest on the eve of her daughter’s wedding to explore “the obscenity of the loss” and illuminate how scorching grief, guilt, regrets and the deep need for human connection are woven into the very flammable fabric of humanity. Yes, the title is schmaltzy and the set-up feels ripped from the headlines.  But the novel, shifting between various survivors, builds in intensity as it reveals what really happened, what was at stake and lost in the conflagration, and the solace and hopefulness to be found in connecting with others."
Honeydew,Edith Pearlman,Heller McAlpin,1,Rose,,0,1,,,,,,,Short Stories; Family Matters; Seriously Great Writing; Realistic Fiction; Book Club Ideas,,"Like melon and proscuitto, the 20 bittersweet, unconventional love stories in Honeydew delectably combine sweet and salty.  Many are set in Godolphin, Mass., Pearlman’s fictional stand-in for Brookline, the Boston suburb that’s home to a multicultural mix of doctors, academics, realtors and their brainy offspring – and Pearlman.  She wields sly charm and a precise vocabulary, writing elegantly even about sex and compassionately about people who learn to adjust their expectations and recognize the merits of being “happy enough.” These penetrating stories, a worthy follow-up to Binocular Vision,  her 2012 National Book Critics Circle winner, are ripe with loss and pain yet reaffirm the value of living."
Nein: a Manifesto,Eric Jarosinksi,Heller McAlpin,1,Rose,,0,0,,,,,,,Comics & Graphic Novels; Rather Short; Eye-opening; Philosophical; Funny Stuff,,"Oh, the joys of negativity! Jarosinski, a self-proclaimed failed intellectual who leapt off the tenure track in modern German critical theory, has made it his mission to fight “a world of yes.  A tyranny of yes.” This profoundly clever chapbook of brainy, nihilistic, dour but playful aphorisms began as work-avoiding tweets. With the stern-faced, monocled German-Jewish philosopher Theodor W. Adorno as his avatar,  Jarosinski riffs succinctly and brilliantly on Nietzsche, Freud, Marx, philosophy, and language as he gleefully plumbs the sinkhole of existential hopelessness. A few favorites: “-Ologies: Are usually taut,” (31) “Atheism: A religion without a prayer,” (117) and “Telling a tale full of sound and fury: Idiot-proof. Signifying nothing: “Harder than it looks.” (56)   An aphorism, he writes, is “Philosophy’s ship in literature’s bottle.” (49) In my book, Nein is a big Yes."
The Fly Trap,Fredrik Sjoberg,Heller McAlpin,1,Rose,,0,0,,,,,,,Memoir; Science; Seriously Great Writing; Rather Short; Eye-Opening; Tales From Around the World; For Nature Lovers; Funny Stuff,,"A charming memoir about a Swedish biologist’s passion for hoverflies? Seriously?  Yes.  Talk about off-the-beaten track, Fredrik Sjöberg, who lives on the tiny island of Runmarö in the archipelago east of Stockholm, muses and amuses about his baffling passion for hoverflies.  In this wry, delightful paean to some of the tiniest wonders of the natural world, he also makes a case for the opposite of globalism – cutting our overwhelming world down to size by focusing intensely on a narrow point of interest. The Fly Trap proves that great writing can elevate anything – including a swarm of insects."
Early Warning and Golden Age,Jane Smiley,Heller McAlpin,1,Rose,,0,1,,,,,,,Rather Long; Family Matters; Realistic Fiction; Book Club Ideas,,"Jane Smiley’s sweeping, cumulatively addictive Last Hundred Years trilogy follows an Iowa farm family from 1920-2019, with a chapter devoted to each year.   The Langdons disperse across the country, fight wars overseas, serve in Congress, make and lose bundles on Wall Street, marry and divorce, and suffer the effects of climate change.  Breeding and hybridization – of crops, farm animals and people – are recurrent themes. The trilogy’s power lies in the unfolding lives of a Russian novel’s worth of characters who share DNA and an eroded connection to a patch of Iowa land, if little else.  “Golden Age,” with more deaths than births, provides a satisfying though sober finale to Smiley’s saga, as her surviving characters wonder if the golden age is perhaps behind them."
Between You and Me,Mary Norris,Heller McAlpin,1,Rose,,0,1,,,,,,,Funny Stuff; Memoir; Grammar; Eye-Opening Reads,,"Between You and Me is part memoir, part guide to the mindbending nuances of English grammar, part homage to The New Yorker -- where Mary Norris has spent more than 20 years as a highly specialized proofreader -- and completely delightful.  It brims with wit, personality,  and commas. Norris is a stickler who can’t resist schtick.  She pounces gleefully on typos and is as passionate about sharp pencils --  soft graphite Palomina Blackwing 602 pencils, to be specific -- as she is about sharp writing.  Despite her insistence on maintaining grammatical standards, a prim and regal comma queen she is not.  In fact, she is vociferous in her defense of judiciously deployed profanity – which adds punch to her explanation of why “between you and I,” in trying to be “so f-ing polite,” is just wrong, wrong, wrong. "
M Train,Patti Smith,Heller McAlpin,1,Rose,,0,1,,,,,,,Memoir; For Music Lovers; Rather Short; Seriously Great Writing; Book Club Ideas,,"Patti Smith writes exquisitely and achingly about loss and the things that matter to her in her second memoir.  Unlike the mostly chronological narrative of Just Kids, which centered on her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe, M Train is a running mental locomotive of memories and dreams, with little about her performance career. The tone is elegiac, melancholic, and meditative as she evokes people who died far too young, including – most devastatingly – her husband Fred “Sonic” Smith and her brother Todd, both in 1994.  But the book is energized by various passions, including coffee, television detective mysteries, far-flung pilgrimages to the graves of artistic and literary touchstones, and a rundown property she buys near the beach in Far Rockaway, Queens, just weeks before Hurricane Sandy devastated the area.  "
My Kitchen Year,Ruth Reichl,Heller McAlpin,,Rose,,0,1,,,,,,,"Cookbooks & Food, Memoir",,"When Gourmet abruptly ceased publishing in 2009, Ruth Reichl, its editor-in-chief for 10 years, retreated from Manhattan to her upstate New York hilltop glass house.   Clearly not wired for the retiring life, she threw herself into writing My Kitchen Year,  an unabashedly sentimental memoir about the restorative solace of cooking and the redemptive power of “finding joy in ordinary things.” But even better, it’s a collection of 136 recipes, mostly comfort food and the stuff of cravings.  With her predilection for lemons, splashes of Sriracha, and fistfuls of cilantro, it’s clear that Reichl likes assertive pick-me-up foods.  She’s also assertive in her opinions.  For example, about her favorite “ethereal” yeast-raised waffles, a Fannie Farmer classic, she comments, “There are easier waffle recipes, but they’re little more than pancakes with dents.” Plenty to feast on here."
The Story of My Teeth,Valeria Luiselli,Heller McAlpin,1,Rose,,1,1,,,,,,,Seriously Great Writing; Tales from around the world; Rather Short; Book Club Ideas,,"Quirky and inventive, Valeria Luiselli’s second novel, written in collaboration with Mexican Jumex juice factory workers,  is a playful, philosophical funhouse of a read that demonstrates that not only isn’t experimental fiction dead, it needn’t be deadly, either.  Luiselli’s elastic mind comfortably wraps itself around molars, Montaigne, fortune cookies, and theories of identity and storytelling.  Her charming narrator is an auctioneer who can amp up the value of anything – including his extracted chompers – by embellishing them with hyperbolic, allegoric stories that deliciously “surpass the truth.”"

Letter to a Future Lover,Ander Monson,Michael Schaub,1,Rose,,,,,,,,,,"Seriously Great Writing, Rather Short, Book Club Ideas",,"For Ander Monson, libraries are something more than just buildings filled with books. He's interested in libraries as a concept, as a living, adapting exchange of ideas, as a way people can connect with one another, even across generations. Monson’s latest is a breathtakingly original consideration of what it means to be a reader — or a writer, or a human being. His focus isn't books, but rather the things we find in them: notes, date due slips, scrawlings in the margins. As an essay collection, it's magnificent; as a love letter, it's a work of overwhelming devotion and generosity."
One of Us,Asne Seierstad,Michael Schaub,1,Rose,,,,,,,,,,"Eye-Opening Reads, Rather Long, The Dark Side",,"Journalist Seierstad's recounting of the 2011 massacre in Norway, in which an ultra-right wing terrorist killed 77 people, most of them children, is unimaginably difficult to read. But it’s worth it: her writing, translated into English by Sarah Death, is both straightforward and compassionate. One of Us is a masterpiece of journalism, a deeply painful chronicle of an inexplicable and horrifying attack that we'll likely never understand. "
The Book of Aron,Jim Shepard,Michael Schaub,1,Rose,,,0,,,,,,,"Historical Fiction, Seriously Great Writing, The Dark Side",,"Shepard’s latest novel tells the story of Aron, a Polish boy living in Warsaw when the Nazis invade. The book shares some predictable traits with other works of fiction about the Holocaust — it's horrifying, brutal and angry. But Shepard, who for years has been one of this country's greatest fiction writers, is as original here as he has ever been. It's an immensely rewarding, shocking and beautiful book."
The Visiting Privilege,Joy Williams,Michael Schaub,1,Rose,,,1,,,,,,,"Family Matters, Poetry & Short Stories, Rather Long, Seriously Great Writing, Realistic Fiction",,"The Visiting Privilege is the rare collection that doesn't have a single story, even a single paragraph, that's less than brilliant, and it proves that Williams is quite possibly America's best living writer of short stories. She is our poet laureate of loss and mourning, but she's so much more than that — she seems to have a supernatural ability to show what makes us function as people, at our best and at our worst. And most importantly, she celebrates our vulnerabilities, the moments that make us so imperfect and broken and essentially human."
"Don’t Suck, Don’t Die",Kristin Hersh,Michael Schaub,1,Rose,,,1,,,,,,,"Biography & Memoir, For Music Lovers, Rather Short, Seriously Great Writing, The Dark Side",,"Throwing Muses frontwoman Hersh recounts the time she spent with her friend Vic Chesnutt, the indie rock legend who died in 2009 at age 45. Written mostly in the second person, it’s essentially a tender, angry love letter to Chesnutt. Don't Suck, Don't Die is not only one of the best books of the year, it's one of the most beautiful rock memoirs ever written. Hersh is as stunningly talented an author as she is a musician, and her portrayal of Chesnutt is perfectly done."
Find Me,Laura van den Berg,Michael Schaub,1,Rose,,,1,,,,,,,"Book Club Ideas, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Seriously Great Writing, The Dark Side",,"Van den Berg’s novel follows Joy, a young woman who’s taken to a hospital in rural Kansas after surviving a pandemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans. Find Me is both touching and haunting, an extremely powerful look at the fragility of human life, the connections we make in dire circumstances, and the will to survive even when it seems like there’s no point."
Barbara the Slut,Lauren Holmes,Michael Schaub,1,Rose,,,1,,,,,,,"Poetry & Short Stories, Book Club Ideas, Funny Stuff, Realistic Fiction",,"The characters in Holmes’ debut short story collection are fully, sometimes exasperatingly real, portrayed by a young writer with a great deal of charm and not a hint of pretension. The stories in this book are sometimes painful, sometimes brilliantly funny, and most often both; Holmes can find the humor in the worst situations, and the tragedy in the most glorious moments. But it's her characters that carry the stories — imperfect, difficult and defiantly human. In other words, they're people. Just like us."
Speak,Louisa Hall,Michael Schaub,1,Rose,,,1,,,,,,,"Eye-Opening Reads, Historical Fiction, It’s All Geek to Me, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Seriously Great Writing",,"An inventor is imprisoned for making baby dolls that are too realistic. A Puritan girl, married against her will, sails to America with her dog. A programmer’s wife shuns him in favor of a sentient computer he created. In this stunning and audacious second novel from author Hall, perspectives shift between different eras and places, twisting together to form a story that's as hard to describe as it is remarkable.It's not just one of the smartest books of the year, it's one of the most beautiful ones."
The Water Museum,Luis Alberto Urrea,Michael Schaub,1,Rose,,,0,,,,,,,"Poetry & Short Stories, Realistic Fiction, Seriously Great Writing",,"Most of the stories in The Water Museum take place in the American West and Southwest, but they’re all universal. It's difficult to find comparisons to an author as original as Urrea, but you could say that he's kind of a country-punk Lorrie Moore, compassionate but hard-edged, a kind of literary badass who still believes in love, because sometimes, there's nothing much else to believe in. The Water Museum is a brilliant, powerful collection, and Luis Alberto Urrea is a master storyteller with a rock 'n' roll heart."
In the Country,Mia Alvar,Michael Schaub,1,Rose,,,0,,,,,,,"Poetry & Short Stories, Book Club Ideas, Realistic Fiction, Tales from Around the World",,"Set variously in the Philippines, the U.S. and Bahrain, In the Country is a stunning short story collection about people who have little to nothing in common with one another, except that they're all trying to find a home, and it's always a more challenging task than anyone would expect. Alvar finds beauty in the unlikeliest of places, and that's what makes In the Country such an inspired, remarkable book."
The Sellout,Paul Beatty,Michael Schaub,1,Rose,,,0,,,,,,,"Book Club Ideas, Funny Stuff, Seriously Great Writing",,"The story of an African American man who attempts to bring back slavery and resegregate his Los Angeles neighborhood, The Sellout is the funniest American satire in years. It's a risky book unconcerned about offending readers, and also a comic masterpiece. But it's much more than just that — it's one of the smartest and most honest reflections on race and identity in America in a very long time, written by an author who truly understands what it means to talk about the history of the country."
See How Small,Scott Blackwood,Michael Schaub,1,Rose,,,0,,,,,,,"Eye-Opening Reads, Mysteries & Thrillers, Realistic Fiction, The Dark Side",,"Blackwood’s novel is inspired by inspired by the Austin yogurt shop murders, a grisly unsolved case from 1991, in which four young girls were murdered, and the store where they worked was set ablaze. Blackwood writes with compassionate eyes, beautifully poetic writing and artistic fearlessness. See How Small is a brutal, necessary and near perfect novel."
Among the Wild Mulattos,Tom Williams,Michael Schaub,1,Rose,,,0,,,,,,,"Eye-Opening Reads, Funny Stuff, Poetry & Short Stories, Seriously Great Writing",,"Identity, both racial and otherwise, is at the heart of nearly all the stories in Among the Wild Mulattos, a manic, cutting and frequently hilarious collection from Kentucky author and academic Williams. He's an uncompromising writer with a fiercely original voice, and he's created one of the most unforgettable books of the year. The collection feels vital, essential, not only for the unexpected ways Williams talks about identity, but for his brash, gutsy writing."
