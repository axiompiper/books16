Even if you don’t plan on writing a memoir, thinking about memory and communicating past events will set your mind tumbling over itself. And second as a resource, a bibliography. The books she mentions promise to be great reads. (The ones I’ve read are, so there’s no reason to think the others won’t be.) Oh, and one more. If you ARE planning on writing a memoir, this is the best possible way to procrastinate putting pen to paper. "
On the Move: A Life,Oliver Sacks,Hannah Bloch,0,Nicole,Biography & Memoir,0,0,,,,,,,"Biography & Memoir, Seriously Great Writing",,"Reading this New York Times essay by Oliver Sacks in mid-August moved me so much that I immediately picked up On the Move, his memoir, and was completely absorbed. It’s an intimate, generous and insightful reflection on Sacks’s full and varied life: the shock of his mother’s rejection when she learned he was gay, his forays into weightlifting, fast motorcycles and drugs, his exceptional career as neurologist and writer, his late-life experience of love at age 75 – and always, his curiosity and empathy for others. The book is so powerful that when this great scientist-humanist died -- two weeks after I turned the last page -- it felt like a personal loss.

M Train,Patti Smith,Heller McAlpin,1,Rose,Biography & Memoir,0,1,,,,,,,Memoir; For Music Lovers; Rather Short; Seriously Great Writing; Book Club Ideas,,"Patti Smith writes exquisitely and achingly about loss and the things that matter to her in her second memoir.  Unlike the mostly chronological narrative of Just Kids, which centered on her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe, M Train is a running mental locomotive of memories and dreams, with little about her performance career. The tone is elegiac, melancholic, and meditative as she evokes people who died far too young, including – most devastatingly – her husband Fred “Sonic” Smith and her brother Todd, both in 1994.  But the book is energized by various passions, including coffee, television detective mysteries, far-flung pilgrimages to the graves of artistic and literary touchstones, and a rundown property she buys near the beach in Far Rockaway, Queens, just weeks before Hurricane Sandy devastated the area.

"Don’t Suck, Don’t Die",Kristin Hersh,Michael Schaub,1,Rose,Biography & Memoir,0,1,,,,,,,"Biography & Memoir, For Music Lovers, Rather Short, Seriously Great Writing, The Dark Side",,"Throwing Muses frontwoman Hersh recounts the time she spent with her friend Vic Chesnutt, the indie rock legend who died in 2009 at age 45. Written mostly in the second person, it’s essentially a tender, angry love letter to Chesnutt. Don't Suck, Don't Die is not only one of the best books of the year, it's one of the most beautiful rock memoirs ever written. Hersh is as stunningly talented an author as she is a musician, and her portrayal of Chesnutt is perfectly done."
My Kitchen Year,Ruth Reichl,Heller McAlpin,,Rose,Biography & Memoir,0,1,,,,,,,"Cookbooks & Food, Memoir",,"When Gourmet abruptly ceased publishing in 2009, Ruth Reichl, its editor-in-chief for 10 years, retreated from Manhattan to her upstate New York hilltop glass house.   Clearly not wired for the retiring life, she threw herself into writing My Kitchen Year,  an unabashedly sentimental memoir about the restorative solace of cooking and the redemptive power of “finding joy in ordinary things.” But even better, it’s a collection of 136 recipes, mostly comfort food and the stuff of cravings.  With her predilection for lemons, splashes of Sriracha, and fistfuls of cilantro, it’s clear that Reichl likes assertive pick-me-up foods.  She’s also assertive in her opinions.  For example, about her favorite “ethereal” yeast-raised waffles, a Fannie Farmer classic, she comments, “There are easier waffle recipes, but they’re little more than pancakes with dents.” Plenty to feast on here."

While his prose at first presents the polished self-presentation of a monologue or a stand-up comedy routine, Oliver doesn’t bore by remaining on the shiny surface. He performs a daring emotional striptease, stripping away the layers of a stock character (the promiscuous single gay man) to reveal the heart and soul beneath. "

A brave, discerning 17-year-old, she is selected from among the girls in her village to serve an enigmatic sorcerer called the Dragon, who protects the region from a terrible power that lies at its border. While the thrill of this novel comes from Agnieszka’s growing awareness of her own magical ability, its true power lies in the complexity of its female characters, who are responsible for the most villainous acts, as well as the most heroic in the novel."

No, it’s the way in which the main character, an elusive celebrity chef of destination dining, gets revealed. The book is a chronological series of vignettes in various degrees of contact with her life, from conception and an infancy in which her father feeds her puréed pork shoulder to her thirties, about which you best read yourself. Never, though, is she the main actor in the events. I’m still scratching my head about how Stradal pulled it off.  "

",,"McCathy himself writes in the novel (parenthetically, how else?): “(events! If you want those, you’d best stop reading now)”. So it’s not a page-turner. But it is a mind-turner, and sometimes that kind of book hits the spot just perfectly. The nameless protagonist (okay, he has a name: U) is a corporate anthropologist – he studies businesses as cultures – and is inspired by events around him (failed parachute in news; oil spill; friend’s cancer; girlfriend’s interrogation by sinister forces) to develop a Grand Theory of Everything.  Therefore, no real story results but the thinking and the sentence-writing is breathtaking. "
A God in Ruins,Kate Atkinson,Ari Shapiro,0,Nicole,fiction,0,1,,,,,,,,,"Buy a house in East London today, and a realtor may warn you that the foundation is uneven because of bomb damage from World War 2. British people have a more personal relationship to the second World War than most Americans do. That immediacy comes through vividly in Kate Atkinson’s novel, A God In Ruins. Her main character, Teddy, is a heroic fighter pilot, whose exploits feel more harrowing than heroic. It’s Atkinson’s second book exploring the same family, after her virtuosic 2013 novel, Life After Life. We should be so lucky to get a third. "
A Little Life: A Novel,Hanya Yanagihara,Audie Cornish,0,Nicole,fiction,1,1,,,,,,,,,"At nearly 800 pages A Little Life feels like it’s telling the story of its New York foursome in real time – over takeout, at parties, in dinners that end in arguments. It’s most moving when author Hanya Yanagihara lets us live long stretches with the character of Jude -- a survivor of child abuse. The book doesn't shy away from those horrors or the physical and emotional pain endured to overcome them. And it’s not afraid to show how his friends love him, care for him and sometimes let him down."
Delicious Foods: A Novel,James Hannaham,Audie Cornish,0,Nicole,fiction,1,0,,,,,,,,,Delicious Foods starts where some other books might end. Its hero – Eddie – is a bloodied survivor. The book tells us how he got there. Through the corrupt farm where he and other unlucky job seekers end up trapped and treated like modern day slaves. And it’s a bittersweet story of a young man and his drug addled mother -- a woman who careens through life -- despite his best efforts to hold on. 
The Big Green Tent: A Novel,Ludmila Ulitskaya,Colin Dwyer,0,Nicole,fiction,1,1,,,,,,,"Tales From Around The World, Rather Long, Seriously Great Writing",,"Ludmila Ulitskaya’s novel leaps whole decades in a single bound, weaves intricate webs of connection between dozens of characters -- and sure makes brief recommendations like this one a hell of a task. How best to label it? A coming-of-age tale of three boyhood friends? A record of Soviet dissident artists, a novel of manners, a historical thriller, a story of mentors and students? Somehow, it manages to slip into every one of these categories (and more) -- and then to defy them in turn. At once vast, intimate and riveting, it eludes a 100-word summary. So, instead, I’ll say just three: Please read it."
The Dirty Dust,Máirtín Ó Cadhain,Colin Dwyer,0,Nicole,fiction,0,0,,,,,,,"Tales From Around The World, Seriously Great Writing",,"Chances are, unless you’ve been brushing up on your modern Irish, you haven’t read Mairtin O Cadhairn or this 1949 novel. But don’t sweat it: Very few in the English-speaking world had either -- until it finally got an English translation this year. The book, a foul-mouthed gabfest between corpses in a small-town graveyard, can be a tough one to pin down. It’s at once simple in premise and complex in execution; and while not much of note actually happens, its playful turns of phrase -- and remarkably inventive profanity -- give a lot of bawdy life to this challenging dialogue of the dead."
Undermajordomo Minor: A Novel,Patrick deWitt,Colin Dwyer,0,Nicole,fiction,0,0,,,,,,,,,"Poor Lucy. The leading man of DeWitt’s book, Lucien Minor, isn’t much to write home about -- or look at, or listen to. He’s a liar who’s no good at lying, an underling to a castle servant and, what’s more, a suitor to a taken woman. Still, he makes for a fitting guide -- charmingly befuddled and besieged by circumstance -- especially when the reader may be feeling the same way, in this twist on the common folk tale. DeWitt takes on familiar tropes just to turn them on their heads, and the results are by turns funny, fascinating and often plain weird -- a bit like Lucy himself."

Her story is messy and devastating and raw -- deeply felt and deftly told. Through the experience of Ari, a hardcore feminist party girl/academic, Albert explores the most difficult part of becoming a mother -- the eclipsing of your identity and your relationships and the struggle to find your footing in a completely new world. It will leave you marveling at the power women have to survive, to break each other’s hearts and, when we’re lucky, to rescue each other."

A Spool of Blue Thread: A novel ,Anne Tyler,Lynn Neary,0,Nicole,fiction,0,1,,,,,,,,,"To me,  reading an Anne Tyler book is like hanging out with an old friend.   You open the book to  the first page, and emerge three hours later  surprised that so much time has gone by.    So many of  Tyler's books seem  familiar. They are often stories about a Baltimore family headed by a quirky mother.   Whatever crisis arises somehow  gets  resolved in  a satisfying  way.  ""A Spool of Blue Thread"" fits perfectly  into that mold.   Abby and Red Whitshank are getting old and their four children, including the often absent black sheep, are eager to  help them stay in the beloved family home.  Sibling rivalries flare up. Family secrets are spilled.  The Whitchanks emerge bruised but a little wiser at the end of it all.  Pull up a comfortable chair and enjoy yourself. "

My admiration continues with ""Fates and Furies"" though this time  I was also sucked in by a plot that  had me sneaking off to read the book  while laundry piled up and chores went undone.  It's the story of a marriage between Lotto, short for Lancelot and Mathilde. They meet and marry in a rush of passion. He expects only  good things from life and with Mathilde by his  side he has both  love and  success. But their story is told in two parts  and when we see the marriage from Mathilde's perspective it takes on darker sheen.  Enough said.  Forget the laundy, just dig in.   "

The son of an African American mother and an Irish American father  Johnson  grew up  looking white but feeling black.    ""Loving Day"" is Johnson 's  satirical  take on what  it means to be bi-racial in America. Warren Duffy, who shares some biographical traits with Johnson,  discovers  in  the middle of a mid life crisis that  he has a teenage  daughter. His desire to make her comfortable in her bi-racial skin leads him to a mixed race  commune full of odd characters and misfits. Johnson's   heightened  awareness of racial ambiguity  coupled with a keen sense of  humor  are on full display in ""Loving Day"". "

He is one of millions who migrated  from the countryside  beginning  in the 1950s.    As Mevlut  wanders the  hidden corners and side streets of Istanbul selling  Boza, a traditional Turkish drink, readers  get a glimpse of the religious, economic and political  forces swirling through  the rapidly changing city.  On the homefront,  Mevlut's elopement with  a woman he never meant to marry  turns into an enduring love.   Pamuk's  fondness  for both his character and his city shines  through on every page. "

Amy Stewart resurrects a very real heroine from history.  In 1914 New Jersey, Constance Kopp dared to pursue justice for herself and her sisters.  The story is set in motion by what must have been pretty common back then -- horse buggy versus car accident.  The adventures that follow are anything but mundane and set Constance on a path to becoming one of the first female deputy Sheriffs in the U.S.  And how I smiled when I found out this is the first of a trilogy!"

Translated by Ellie Robins, the novel delves into the troubled political and economic history of Argentina. As great stories often do, it begins with a body, that of a steel company executive who, sent to deliver an attaché case full of money, dies in a helicopter crash. Was this event an accident or a planned execution? The unnamed narrator asks these questions while also weaving stories concerning his personal history with money and how it complicates our lives. Pauls' book is a beautifully textured one chalk full with sentences that consistently dazzle the reader."

Translated by Alfred MacAdam, this multigenerational chronicle introduces a host of memorable characters, from a dwarf prostitute and a floating ghost-Rabbi, to a lion tamer who eats raw meat and teaches his beasts to jump through flaming hoops. Fantastical elements aside, Where the Bird Sings Best is a fiercely original immigration tale that culminates in the author's birth in Chile in 1929 — a complicated time in that nation's history. Combine that with poetry, Tarot, and Jewish mysticism and you have a genius' surreal vision brought to life. "

He finds the foundations for his most enthralling work in the complex ties between fathers and sons, nations and their people, and especially hapless lovers. To read Zambra and a collection like My Documents is to engage with someone who writes as though the burden of history were upon him and no one else — the history of his country of Chile, of literature, and of humanity's shared experience. Put simply, the novel is a force, and further proof that the author is in a class of his own."

Did You Ever Have a Family,Bill Clegg,Heller McAlpin,1,Rose,lit fic,0,0,,,,,,, Book Club ideas; Family Matters; Realistic Fiction; the Dark Side; Seriously Great Writing,,"Bill Clegg’s polished, deeply compassionate debut novel digs through the ashes of a tragic fire that wipes out a woman’s nearest and dearest on the eve of her daughter’s wedding to explore “the obscenity of the loss” and illuminate how scorching grief, guilt, regrets and the deep need for human connection are woven into the very flammable fabric of humanity. Yes, the title is schmaltzy and the set-up feels ripped from the headlines.  But the novel, shifting between various survivors, builds in intensity as it reveals what really happened, what was at stake and lost in the conflagration, and the solace and hopefulness to be found in connecting with others."
Early Warning and Golden Age,Jane Smiley,Heller McAlpin,1,Rose,lit fic,0,1,,,,,,,Rather Long; Family Matters; Realistic Fiction; Book Club Ideas,,"Jane Smiley’s sweeping, cumulatively addictive Last Hundred Years trilogy follows an Iowa farm family from 1920-2019, with a chapter devoted to each year.   The Langdons disperse across the country, fight wars overseas, serve in Congress, make and lose bundles on Wall Street, marry and divorce, and suffer the effects of climate change.  Breeding and hybridization – of crops, farm animals and people – are recurrent themes. The trilogy’s power lies in the unfolding lives of a Russian novel’s worth of characters who share DNA and an eroded connection to a patch of Iowa land, if little else.  “Golden Age,” with more deaths than births, provides a satisfying though sober finale to Smiley’s saga, as her surviving characters wonder if the golden age is perhaps behind them."

Luiselli’s elastic mind comfortably wraps itself around molars, Montaigne, fortune cookies, and theories of identity and storytelling.  Her charming narrator is an auctioneer who can amp up the value of anything – including his extracted chompers – by embellishing them with hyperbolic, allegoric stories that deliciously “surpass the truth.”"

In Purity, he turns his gaze on state surveillance, online privacy, the student loan bubble, tech culture, and feminism. At the center of it all is Purity Tyler, a recent college graduate who wants to find out the truth about her father. As in Franzen’s previous novels, there are multiple and intertwining plots, superbly crafted scenes, and exquisitely observed moments. But it’s his characters that will keep you reading: they’re angry and yet frail; sensitive and yet oblivious; smart and yet wrong about so many things. "
The Book of Aron,Jim Shepard,Michael Schaub,1,Rose,lit fic,0,0,,,,,,,"Historical Fiction, Seriously Great Writing, The Dark Side",,"Shepard’s latest novel tells the story of Aron, a Polish boy living in Warsaw when the Nazis invade. The book shares some predictable traits with other works of fiction about the Holocaust — it's horrifying, brutal and angry. But Shepard, who for years has been one of this country's greatest fiction writers, is as original here as he has ever been. It's an immensely rewarding, shocking and beautiful book."

In this stunning and audacious second novel from author Hall, perspectives shift between different eras and places, twisting together to form a story that's as hard to describe as it is remarkable.It's not just one of the smartest books of the year, it's one of the most beautiful ones."
The Sellout,Paul Beatty,Michael Schaub,1,Rose,lit fic,1,0,,,,,,,"Book Club Ideas, Funny Stuff, Seriously Great Writing",,"The story of an African American man who attempts to bring back slavery and resegregate his Los Angeles neighborhood, The Sellout is the funniest American satire in years. It's a risky book unconcerned about offending readers, and also a comic masterpiece. But it's much more than just that — it's one of the smartest and most honest reflections on race and identity in America in a very long time, written by an author who truly understands what it means to talk about the history of the country."

Blackwood writes with compassionate eyes, beautifully poetic writing and artistic fearlessness. See How Small is a brutal, necessary and near perfect novel."

The author, who's work went on to be translated to dozens of languages, once described her first novel as the “interior movements that precede and prepare our words and actions, at the limits of our consciousness.” This collection of vignettes – made of short scenes and anecdotes – reads like quiet prose poems that stay with the reader.

Phrases like “op-too-much-stic”  –hopeful in that way that sets the stage for perilous disappointment - from the droll, fantastic tale of children raised by wolves, mysteriously connected to the cursed Ashton family of Victorian-era estate life, guided through danger and artistic development by their sensible and endearing teenage governess have made it into my family’s everyday conversation.

As with any series, I started reading The Penderwicks in Spring with nervous anticipation. Would we still like them? Would they be true to who we’ve grown to know? Yes and yes. And what we loved (I say we, because I read the book as I have all of the Penderwicks with my twin daughters), was that Batty who has charmed us from the start got to come of age and we saw the oldest, Rosalind, off to college. Jeanne Birdsall has given us the gift of sisterly love again."
Goodbye Stranger,Rebecca Stead,Justine Kenin,0,Nicole,middle Grade,0,1,,,,,,,,,"The structure of Goodbye Stranger and the respect author, Rebecca Stead, gives her main characters drive this amazing book.  It centers on a group of girlfriends entering middle school, how they define and redefine themselves, determined to stick together.  Scenes with these girls cut to scenes of an older girl, who remains a mystery for much of the book, but whose world overlaps the younger girls.  It’s a funny and warm page turner that challenges conventional wisdom about mean girls and social media."

Neighbor two doors down disappears. “Girl” gets involved. The story is told in the first person alternately by three different characters (“Girl”, missing neighbor, and new wife); in incremental chunks of morning and evening diary-like entries, and you’re never quite sure who or what to believe. 
Or
There’s nothing like missing information to generate interest, and here it comes from several angles. Foremost, the main first-person narrator is an unemployed alcoholic divorcée, so not only does she black out, but she twists her memories to make herself look better. Then there’s the narrative technique of revealing information at the time of the morning and evening commute. Glimpses, fleeting images, faulty memories, all adding up to a super-intriguing “what the * is going on?” story. This is edge-of-the-seat frustration, not throw-the-book-away frustration.

So, that’s uncomfortable. The good news, and the reason why I recommend this book to anyone who loves words, is that Larissa MacFarquhar writes so simply and beautifully that I frequently forget my discomfort and just let her narrative carry me along. In fact, this a book that would be less upsetting if it never ended, and we could all just live in her prose forever, and never face the upshot, which is that it’s very, very difficult to be a good person."

What followed rivals the 1913 premiere of Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring” in the annals of musical disruption. Fortunately, cultural historian Wald wasn’t content to let sleeping legends lie. Wald revisits the infamous concert set through contemporary accounts (including pages from one fan’s scrapbook) and interviews with surviving participants. The result leaves those of us who weren’t there wishing we had been. It’s rollicking, poignant and fun."
Katrina: After the Flood,Gary Rivlin,Cheryl Devall ,0,Nicole,nonfiction,0,0,,,,,,,Eye-Opening Reads,,"Investigative reporters have long followed this rule from Woodward and Bernstein’s Watergate playbook: “Follow the money.” Rivlin applies that dictum to power, politics and planning in New Orleans before and after the infamous 2005 deluge. With its focus on the central role of black-owned Liberty Bank in the development of areas inhabited largely by New Orleans’ African American professional class, the book offers a strong, infuriating argument that Katrina was a catastrophe decades in the making, abetted by the powers that be on the local, state and national level. The narrative includes heroes, too: Liberty’s chief executive Alden McDonald, the publishers of the monthly New Orleans Tribune and the endearingly bourgeois, resourceful and indomitable Wall sisters Petie, Contesse, Cassandra and Tangee.

Between the World and Me,Ta-Nehisi Coates,Cheryl Devall ,0,Nicole,nonfiction,1,0,,,,,,,,,"This volume – conceived as a letter from the author to his son, Samori – punches way above its weight as provocation and analysis. As in his Polk Award-winning article for The Atlantic, “The Case for Reparations,” this book intends to unsettle complacency with research and bracing rhetoric. Its central question: “How do I live free in this black body?” is far less haunting, Coates argues, than the ever-fresh episodes of violence against black bodies that made possible this nation that prides itself on its striving toward “a more perfect union.” In beautiful prose, Coates bequeaths to his child the clear-eyed approach of his parents, “who never tried to console me with ideas of an afterlife and were skeptical of preordained American glory.” Those gifts, he maintains, make it possible for him to pose unanswerable questions without fearing the consequences. Some readers may regard his conclusions as grim; others are likely to find them liberating. Discuss among yourselves."

Happily, Vowell’s funny, unpretentious meander through history is ready to remind us that -- even when he was helping the patriots find their footing in the Revolution -- Lafayette was once a teenager, too. Vowell may not take herself (or her subjects) too seriously, but her smirk never stands in the way of a good yarn. She manages a quick, quippy -- and edifying -- history of our “all-American inability to get our s*** together.”"

The brothers were an unlikely  pair,  complementing each other at every stage and thriving in their insular world.

But media columnist and author Michael Wolff -- whose enemies list is so long, he fills the book’s back page with insults from the New York Times and Gawker -- is just that pot-stirrer. This book argues our love for shiny new concepts has blinded us to a simple fact: TV keeps making money while digital media still traffics in pennies, comparatively. And instead of replacing television, digital video outlets like Netflix, Amazon and Google’s YouTube are becoming more like TV. Wolff makes his case with the kind of detail only media nerds will read to the end. But his argument is a great way to stop conversation the next time someone tells you your TV is headed for history’s dustbin.   "

When The Maid finally wades into this political snake pit, her power to  move hearts and armies is both mysterious and astonishing. Castor never goes beyond the bounds of the documents and never succumbs to the modern impulse to psychoanalyze her heroine.  This Joan is a creature of her time: used, destroyed, and sanctified to serve the aims of the powerful. "

So whether you need to know what size rug will work best in your space, or how to infuse your home with comfort and charm, Habitat can help.

The Battle of Versailles: The Night American Fashion Stumbled into the Spotlight and Made History,Robin Givhan,Shannon Rhoades,0,Nicole,nonfiction,1,1,,,,,,,,,"You know that cliché about history ""coming alive?""  Well, in the hands of Pulitzer Prize-winning fashion critic Robin Givhan, this history really does come alive.  On a chilly November night back in 1973, five American designers went toe-to-toe, dress-to-dress, with five French designers in one legendary fashion show.  Seemingly, it was a fundraiser for the restoration of the Place of Versailles.  Lift the hemline just a smidge though, and there is so much at play here -- race, gender, the new world pushing up against the old.  If you're tempted to dismiss this as simply fashion history, don’t."

Compiling work ranging from 2002 to 2014, the book covers both the problematic treatment of female characters in mid-2000s emo lyrics and the abandonment of Christianity by one of Christian rock’s foremost heroes in mere pages.

It brims with wit, personality,  and commas. Norris is a stickler who can’t resist schtick.  She pounces gleefully on typos and is as passionate about sharp pencils --  soft graphite Palomina Blackwing 602 pencils, to be specific -- as she is about sharp writing.  Despite her insistence on maintaining grammatical standards, a prim and regal comma queen she is not.  In fact, she is vociferous in her defense of judiciously deployed profanity – which adds punch to her explanation of why “between you and I,” in trying to be “so f-ing polite,” is just wrong, wrong, wrong.

Monson’s latest is a breathtakingly original consideration of what it means to be a reader — or a writer, or a human being. His focus isn't books, but rather the things we find in them: notes, date due slips, scrawlings in the margins.

Jarosinski, a self-proclaimed failed intellectual who leapt off the tenure track in modern German critical theory, has made it his mission to fight “a world of yes.  A tyranny of yes.” This profoundly clever chapbook of brainy, nihilistic, dour but playful aphorisms began as work-avoiding tweets. With the stern-faced, monocled German-Jewish philosopher Theodor W. Adorno as his avatar,  Jarosinski riffs succinctly and brilliantly on Nietzsche, Freud, Marx, philosophy, and language as he gleefully plumbs the sinkhole of existential hopelessness. A few favorites: “-Ologies: Are usually taut,” (31) “Atheism: A religion without a prayer,” (117) and “Telling a tale full of sound and fury: Idiot-proof. Signifying nothing: “Harder than it looks.” (56)   An aphorism, he writes, is “Philosophy’s ship in literature’s bottle.” (49) In my book, Nein is a big Yes."

In this wry, delightful paean to some of the tiniest wonders of the natural world, he also makes a case for the opposite of globalism – cutting our overwhelming world down to size by focusing intensely on a narrow point of interest. The Fly Trap proves that great writing can elevate anything – including a swarm of insects."

Yard Sale,"Eve Bunting, Lauren Castillo",Lisa Yee,1,Beth,Picture Book,0,1,,,,,,,"Funny Stuff, Kids' Books",,"Yard sales can be fun, unless it’s your favorite things being sold. Callie’s move from a house to a small apartment is told with warmth and compassion. As she watches her family’s belongings being picked over and purchased, Callie’s heartache is achingly palpable. Lauren Castillo’s watercolor and ink illustrations compliment Eve Bunting’s tender first person telling of an event that happens thousands of times everyday.

Home,Carson Ellis,Margaret H. Willison,1,Beth,Picture Book,0,1,,,,,,,"Family Matters, For Art Lovers, Kids' Books",,"A gentle meditation on the idea of what constitutes a home, Carson Ellis’s debut picture book is whimsical and thought-provoking. Ellis’s lovely watercolor illustrations imbue both the grand (Slovakian duchesses’ mansions) and the familiar (an urban apartment) with ornate charm, but it is her inspired depictions of the odd, both labeled (a Norse god’s castle) and left mysterious (an enormous estate encased in a geodesic dome, accompanied by the text “Who in the world lives here? And why?”), that make the book stand out. Best of all, in the final illustration of Ellis’s own studio (“An artist lives here”), each piece of bric-a-brac ties back to the vignettes shown previously, a detail attentive re-readers will surely find delightful. (For ages 4 to 8)"
Last Stop on Market Street,Matt de la Peña Christian Robinson,Rebecca Hersher,1,Beth,Picture Book,1,0,,,,,,,"Kids’ Books, Family Matters",,"A boy and his grandmother live in The City and get to Church on the bus. Along the way, they meet all kinds of people – a person with lots of tattoos (expertly illustrated), a flirty blind man, a dude playing guitar. The boy whines about the rain and about not having a car. The grandmother is stern, but loving. They don’t need a car, and the rain waters the trees by the bus stop. One reason I love this book is that it’s diverse – the boy and his grandmother are black, the people on the bus are from lots of races and backgrounds – but it’s not a book about diversity. It’s a book about a kid and his grandma and The City, and I think most kids will identify with something in its story."
Pool,Jihyeon Lee,Justine Kenin,0,Nicole,picture books,1,1,,,,,,,,,"Pool by JiHyeon Lee is a gorgeous fantasy. It’s a wordless picture book that takes readers and the two protagonists away from an overly crowded pool to a world far below where they frolic with wondrous sea creatures big and small. The colored pencil & oil pastel drawings are so engaging and playful and warm  that they do the thing the best books do keep your eyes roving the pages for little treasures.   Since Pool is Lee’s first book, I can’t wait to see what she creates next."
Waiting ,Kevin Henkes,Justine Kenin,0,Nicole,picture books,0,0,,,,,,,,,"Kevin Henkes is an amazing author.  His range of skill from picture books to young adult novels is without match.  So it’s no surprise that his latest picture book, Waiting, is so terrific.  The dance of words and pictures is subtle and simple and clever and rewards the careful observer.  A collection of toys sits in a windowsill– without a child in the picture, which lets the reader play that role.  Perfect for night after night after night of reading and re-reading like any great picture book."

In this context, his marital infelicity (yes, THAT governor – think “Appalachian Trail”) and other moral shortcomings take a back seat. Deservedly so, for this approach is far more entertaining. And, if you care about language, more indicting. "

Translated by David Frye, the interwoven stories craft a picture of a dystopian future in which an alien species called ""Xenoids"" has invaded planet Earth. Many of the planet's inhabitants are looking to flee, as it has become economically and socially bankrupt. Yoss's smart and entertaining novel tackles themes like prostitution, immigration, and political corruption. Ultimately, it serves as an empathetic yet impassioned metaphor for modern day Cuba, where the struggle for power has complicated every facet of society. "

Translated in English for the first time by Josh Billings, the novel is centered around an odd cast of characters that are completely disconnected from the world and one another. First published in 1970, it follows police inspector Peter Glebsky, a family man anticipating two weeks of vacation, his first in years. Shortly after arriving at the inn, however, strange things begin to unravel, and Glebsky realizes his vacation will be anything but relaxing. After a body surfaces, the story takes on a new level of strange and readers are thrown into a detective story that is nothing short of exhilarating."

The collection, translated by Katrina Dodson, is a perfect introduction to those not familiar with Lispector's work. It is beautifully structured and poignant on all levels. Stories like ""The Escape"" and ""Daydream and Drunkenness of a Young Lady” — which deals with a discontented housewife on the brink of insanity — stay with you like a kind of dream. These 85 stories, some spanning only a few pages, reaffirm her singularity and her reputation as ""the great witch of Brazilian literature."" Long after her death, Lispector continues to champion the possibilities of language, and its ability to mesmerize."

He gets at a meaty substance and then points out that the fact that we can communicate it (well, HE can) denudes it of individuality.

The stories unfold in dry Wyoming and Colorado, where things aren’t good or bad, they just are: ominous and evocative and marvelous and difficult and amusing and bizarre. And definitely worth a reread or two. Though the stories share locations and characters, there’s no overarching narrative. And, though there is no titular story, water appears and drowning occurs. "

Many are set in Godolphin, Mass., Pearlman’s fictional stand-in for Brookline, the Boston suburb that’s home to a multicultural mix of doctors, academics, realtors and their brainy offspring – and Pearlman.  She wields sly charm and a precise vocabulary, writing elegantly even about sex and compassionately about people who learn to adjust their expectations and recognize the merits of being “happy enough.” These penetrating stories, a worthy follow-up to Binocular Vision,  her 2012 National Book Critics Circle winner, are ripe with loss and pain yet reaffirm the value of living."
The Visiting Privilege,Joy Williams,Michael Schaub,1,Rose,short stories,0,1,,,,,,,"Family Matters, Poetry & Short Stories, Rather Long, Seriously Great Writing, Realistic Fiction",,"The Visiting Privilege is the rare collection that doesn't have a single story, even a single paragraph, that's less than brilliant, and it proves that Williams is quite possibly America's best living writer of short stories. She is our poet laureate of loss and mourning, but she's so much more than that — she seems to have a supernatural ability to show what makes us function as people, at our best and at our worst. And most importantly, she celebrates our vulnerabilities, the moments that make us so imperfect and broken and essentially human."
Barbara the Slut,Lauren Holmes,Michael Schaub,1,Rose,short stories,0,1,,,,,,,"Poetry & Short Stories, Book Club Ideas, Funny Stuff, Realistic Fiction",,"The characters in Holmes’ debut short story collection are fully, sometimes exasperatingly real, portrayed by a young writer with a great deal of charm and not a hint of pretension. The stories in this book are sometimes painful, sometimes brilliantly funny, and most often both; Holmes can find the humor in the worst situations, and the tragedy in the most glorious moments. But it's her characters that carry the stories — imperfect, difficult and defiantly human. In other words, they're people. Just like us."

It's difficult to find comparisons to an author as original as Urrea, but you could say that he's kind of a country-punk Lorrie Moore, compassionate but hard-edged, a kind of literary badass who still believes in love, because sometimes, there's nothing much else to believe in. The Water Museum is a brilliant, powerful collection, and Luis Alberto Urrea is a master storyteller with a rock 'n' roll heart."
In the Country,Mia Alvar,Michael Schaub,1,Rose,short stories,1,1,,,,,,,"Poetry & Short Stories, Book Club Ideas, Realistic Fiction, Tales from Around the World",,"Set variously in the Philippines, the U.S. and Bahrain, In the Country is a stunning short story collection about people who have little to nothing in common with one another, except that they're all trying to find a home, and it's always a more challenging task than anyone would expect. Alvar finds beauty in the unlikeliest of places, and that's what makes In the Country such an inspired, remarkable book."

The collection feels vital, essential, not only for the unexpected ways Williams talks about identity, but for his brash, gutsy writing."

She had not thought that would be the worst part. She thought the guilt would be the worst thing, or the stress of constant deception, or falling out of love with her husband, or some awful day of reckoning, but so far none of these things had happened. Only the impatience.”  "
Get in Trouble: Stories,Kelly Link,Lynn Neary,0,Nicole,short story,0,1,,,,,,,,,"I think I am a little late to the party but these days some of my favorite reading experiences  are those books and  stories  where  fantasy, science fiction and  realism get  all mixed up together in a deliciously intriguing package. If  the genre has a name I don't know what it is (not magic realism, though its' influence is felt). I suspect that's because the writers who work this magic don't want to be labelled. Kelly Link is one of them. ""Summer People"", the first story in her collection ""Get in Trouble"", begins as a straightforward tale  that  gives no hint of the mysterious place it will take you before it is over.  Each story introduces you to another world, from  boyfriends  who are literally unreal  to a superpowered lovers' reunion in a ghostly theme park.  Link has a gift for creating  characters with emotional lives that feel deeply  human even  in situations that bear no relation to reality. "

First, it reads like a novel.  Second, you will never doubt that Anthony Marra is in charge.  I began to imagine him standing before a giant bulletin board of timelines, maps, character bios -- like some God-like puppeteer, moving everything into place exactly as he wanted it.  The book covers a vast swath of Russian history, from 1930s Leningrad to modern day.  It is simultaneously tragic, absurd, and poignant.  The last story is his only overreach, but it doesn't matter.  All you really need to know is that you should read this book."

What separates Brookes from many others in the genre is he knows his subject – China – intimately. (Disclosure: Brookes and I were colleagues when he served as a BBC correspondent in Beijing in the 1990s.) Brookes has ripped the plot of Spy Games from the headlines of a real-life Communist Party power-struggle and set it in London, Ethiopia, Hong Kong and a Chinese casino in the jungles of Myanmar. For an atmospheric tale of intrigue centered on the world’s rising super power, Brookes is your man.
